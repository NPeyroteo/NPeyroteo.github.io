This repository contains example code for implementing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from scratch.
The model is used to detect market regimes when trading the spread between the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices.

The main script is `hmm_trading.py` which expects a CSV file named `data_python.csv` with a column called `Visible` representing discrete observations.

```bash
python hmm_trading.py
```
